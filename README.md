# Absinthe

DESCRIPTION:
- Absinthe is an untethered jailbreak for all iPhone, iPod touch, iPad and iPad mini models running iOS 5.0 through 5.0.1.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
- MacOSX 10.5/10.6/10.7/10.8/10.9
- Windows (XP minimum)
- Linux x86/x86_64 (Kernel >= 2.6.24, libgtk+-2.0 >= 2.24.13)

SUPPORTED FIRMWARES:
- iOS 5.0 (iPhone 4s)
- iOS 5.0.1 (iPhone 4s, iPad 2)

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Backup your device using iTunes (or iCloud) before using. If something breaks, you'll always be able to recover your data.
- Those who use backup passwords in iTunes must disable them for now. After doing so, iTunes makes a brand new backup. Please wait for that backup to complete before proceeding! Feel free to re-enable your backup password after jailbreaking.
- Please disable the lock passcode of your iOS device before using evasi0n. It can cause issues.
- If the process gets stuck somewhere, it's safe to restart the program, reboot the device (if necessary by holding down Power and Home until it shuts down), and re-run the process.
